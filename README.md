# Ecosystem-Simulator
A WIP project that simulates an ecosystem and natural selection.

 In the simulation, sharks eat fish. 
 They can reproduce, in which they combine statistics to crudely simulate genetics, and can die from hunger or disease. 
 Disease can be spread or contracted when eating a diseased fish.
 Can change shark and fish population before simulation and analyze graphs when it's done.
